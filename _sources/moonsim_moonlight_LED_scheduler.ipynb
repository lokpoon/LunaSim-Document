    "- _<span style=\"font-variant:small-caps;\">MoonSim</span>: Moonlight scheduler_ does not recreate spectral changes associated with variation in the moon altitude; these are negligible. In other words, moonlight is recreated with a constant spectrum, regardless of moon altitude.\n",
    "- Certain habitats are characterized by unique wavelength-dependent attenuation, which researchers may consider emulating. MOONSIM: Moonlight scheduler gives users the option to adjust the relative intensity of the RGBW channels.\n",
    "- Adjusting the RGBW spectrum require the user to have a profound understanding of the spectral characteristics of their habitat target, and their studied animal’s visual sensitivity. This is, in part, because the RGBW channels have very specific and limited peak and spectral range when compared to the complex spectral properties of natural habitats. Consequently, some habitat light spectrum approximations would be more realistic (e.g., when the spectral peak correspond to one of the RGBW peak), while other approximations might be unsatisfactory.\n",
    "- Knowing the animal’s spectral sensitivity can help to assess the validity of a recreated LED spectrum. For example mammals do not see UV light, so the lack of UV in warm white SK6812 LED strips does not constitute a limitation. However, this might not be the case for animals with UV sensitive vision (including many invertebrates and some vertebrates).\n",

Here, the RGBW channels are all set to the maximum intensity in MoonSim (i.e., R = 1.0, G = 1.0, B = 1.0, W = 1.0). Notice that at the same intensity level, the RGBW channels each produce a different absolute irradiance level (e.g. blue is the strongest at its peak wavelength). The dotted line indicates the spectral peaks of four distinctive habitats (clear ocean {cite}`jerlovMarineOptics1976`, forest understory {cite}`veilleuxNocturnalLightEnvironments2012`, relatively clear Amazon river, tannin-stained black or white water Amazon river {cite}`costaSpatialTemporalVariability2013`). The spectral peak of the clear ocean and blue channel are close, while the far red peak of the tannin-stained river cannot be recreated by the red or white channels. These peaks are, of course, an oversimplified representation of the habitats' spectra; the user should always refer to the complete spectral irradiance plot for a given habitat. Ideally, the user should make their own spectral irradiance measurements at their study site since the spectral properties of the same habitat type (e.g. clear river) can still vary greatly {cite}`johnsenOpticsLifeBiologist2012`.\n",

In the transition zone B between 55 amd 57 degree, a linear transition of illuminance is applied.
