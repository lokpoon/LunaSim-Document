# Lightbox-python LED control

A custom python program runs on the Raspberry Pi. It reads the `moon_output.csv` (or `twilight_sun_output.csv`) generated from the LED scheduler to control the LED output.

## Initial setup



```{code-cell}
print(2 + 2)
```

When your book is built, the contents of any `{code-cell}` blocks will be
executed with your default Jupyter kernel, and their outputs will be displayed
in-line with the rest of your content.

```{seealso}
Jupyter Book uses [Jupytext](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to convert text-based files to notebooks, and can support [many other text-based notebook files](https://jupyterbook.org/file-types/jupytext.html).
```

## Launch with a new output.csv
