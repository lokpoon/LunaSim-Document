# Overview

**LunaSim** and **LS-lightbox**: An R program and LED system to simulate and recreate realistic moonlight and twilight illuminance for nighttime ecological studies.

LunaSim is an R program that predicts ground illuminance (lux) of moonlight, twilight, and sunlight (plus startlight and airglow as a constant) at a any geographic location and time period. The LunaSim suite includes three independent R programs that generates different outputs:
1. **LunaSim-Lux calculator** simply predicts moonlight and twilight illuminance.
2. **LunaSim-Moonlight LED scheduler** predicts only moonlight illuminance, and convert them into LED intensity values (packaged in a .csv output) that serves as a schedule for the LS-lightbox.
3. **LunaSim-Sunlight and twilight LED scheduler** predicts sunlight and twilight illuminance, and convert them into LED intensity values (packaged in a .csv output) that serves as a schedule for the LS-lightbox.

LS-lightbox is a LED system for illuminating room,by using the schedule generated by **LunaSim-Moonlight LED scheduler** or **LunaSim-Sunlight and twilight LED scheduler**. User can run a moonlight schedule and a sunlight and twilight schedule at the same time using two LS-lightboxs, to fully recreate the major sources of natural light around the clock.
