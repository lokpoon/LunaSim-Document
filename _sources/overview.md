# Overview

## _<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">MoonSim</span>_

_<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">MoonSim</span>_ is a suite of three R programs that predicts the ground illuminance of moonlight, twilight, and sunlight at any geographic location and any time (or range of times). The three versions of _<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">MoonSim</span>_ _<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">R</span>_ programs have different purposes, and generate different outputs accordingly:

1. _**<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">MoonSim</span>: Lux calculator**_ simply predicts moonlight and twilight illuminance. It is intended for use in field studies where a biologist requires moonlight illuminance values as a model predictor variable.

_**<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">MoonSim</span>: Moonlight scheduler**_ and _**<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">MoonSim</span>: Sunlight & twilight scheduler**_ are designed for use in combination with _<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">MoonShine</span>_, a hardware-software system that converts a moonlight or sunlight and twilight simulation from _<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">MoonSim</span>_ into an artificial light regime generated by arrays of LEDs (see below).

2. _**<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">MoonSim</span>: Moonlight scheduler**_ predicts only moonlight illuminance values, and convert these into LED intensity values.  It outputs a `LED_schedule_moon.csv` table that serves as the schedule for _<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">MoonShine</span>_.

3. _**<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">MoonSim</span>: Sunlight & twilight scheduler**_ predicts only sunlight and twilight illuminance values, and converts these into LED intensity values. It outputs a `LED_schedule_sun.csv` table that serves as a schedule for _<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">MoonShine</span>_.

## _<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">MoonShine</span>_

_<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">MoonShine</span>_ is an LED control system for recreating realistic moonlight, twilight, and to an extent, sunlight regimes in a laboratory. A light regime can be freely edited, making it ideal for experiments requiring a specific lighting scenario. _<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">MoonShine</span>_ runs a Python program on a Raspberry Pi to control an array of LED strips. Every minute, the python program reads the light schedule (generated by _<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">MoonSim</span>: schedulers_) to refresh the LED intensities. Users can run a moonlight schedule as well as a sunlight and twilight schedule simultaneously on the Pi. In this way, the Pi can separately control two arrays of LED strips, so as to fully re-create all three major sources of natural light, around the clock (see concept in {numref}`map`).

A flowchart of how MoonShine works with the .csv schedule files created by MoonSim to re-create light. MoonShine can either create moonlight only (in a custom-made lightbox with neutral density filter sheets to calibrate light levels to natural moonlight levels), or sunlight and twilight (in a custom made lightbox without filter sheets), or both moonlight and sunlight + twilight together (in two lightboxes, a filtered one for moonlight, and an unfiltered one for sunlight + twilight.
