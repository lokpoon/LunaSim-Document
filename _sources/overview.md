# Overview

## _<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">MoonSim</span>_

_<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">MoonSim</span>_ is a suite of R program that predicts the ground illuminance of moonlight, twilight, and sunlight at a any geographic location and time period. The three _<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">MoonSim</span>_ _<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">R</span>_ programs generate different outputs:

1. _**<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">MoonSim</span>: Lux calculator**_ simply predicts moonlight and twilight illuminance.
    - For example, an ecologist could test for the effect of natural nocturnal light on bat activity level, by using the illuminance prediction as a predictor variable in a statistical model.

2. _**<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">MoonSim</span>: Moonlight scheduler**_ must be used with _<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">MoonShine</span>_ (see below). It predicts only moonlight illuminance, and convert them into LED intensity values. Outputs a `LED_schedule_moon.csv` table that serves as a schedule for _<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">MoonShine</span>_.

3. _**<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">MoonSim</span>: Sunlight & twilight scheduler**_ must be used with _<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">MoonShine</span>_ (see below). It predicts sunlight and twilight illuminance, and convert them into LED intensity values. Outputs a `LED_schedule_sun.csv` table that serves as a schedule for _<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">MoonShine</span>_.

## _<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">MoonShine</span>_

_<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">MoonShine</span>_ is an LED controlling system for recreating realistic illuminance of moonlight, twilight, and to an extent â€“ sunlight in a laboratory. Moreover, the light schedule can be freely edited, making it ideal for experiments requiring a specific lighting scenario. _<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">MoonShine</span>_ runs a python program on a Raspberry Pi to control an array of LED strips. Every minute, the python program reads the light schedule (generated by _<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">MoonSim</span>: schedulers_) to refresh the LED intensities. User can run a moonlight schedule and a sunlight and twilight schedule simultaneously on the Pi. As such, the Pi individually control two arrays of LED strips, to fully recreate all three major sources of natural light around the clock.
