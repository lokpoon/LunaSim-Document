    "- One of the most powerful feature of _<span style=\"font-variant:small-caps;\">MoonSim</span>_ is that the user can create any light scenario by editing the `LED_schedule_moon.csv` or `LED_schedule_sun.csv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- While _<span style=\"font-variant:small-caps;\">MoonSim</span>_ is great for recreating realistic illuminance (by running the `LED_schedule_sun.csv` directly from _<span style=\"font-variant:small-caps;\">MoonSim</span>: Schedulers_), we expect many experiments to require a manipulated (e.g. remove a full moon night from the lunar cycle) or a standardized (e.g. same sunrise/set time everyday).\n",

    "## Problem with Excel datetime\n",
    "- When opening a newly created `LED_schedule .csv` in R, or with a text editor (e.g. Notepad in Windows or TextEdit in Mac), the `datetime` column is presented in this correct format: \n",
    "    - `YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss`\n",
    "\n",
    "```{figure} /images/original_datetime.png\n",
    ":name: original_datetime\n",
    "\n",
    "The correct datetime format when opened with a text editor.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- As soon as the same `LED_schedule .csv` is opened in Excel, the datetime will automatically reformat to the Excel format. How the datetime is reformatted probably depends on the user's computer's country setting. If the user save the `LED_schedule .csv` now, datetime will be in a wrong format that _<span style=\"font-variant:small-caps;\">MoonSim</span>_ does not recognize.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{figure} /images/excel_datetime.png\n",
    ":name: excel_datetime\n",
    "\n",
    "The wrong datetime format as soon as `LED_schedule .csv` is opened in Excel. The order of year, month, and day is wrong, the number of digits are wrong, and the seconds is missing.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- To remedy this issue, the datetime format needs to be specified every time you are opening and saving `LED_schedule .csv` in Excel.\n",
    "    1. Right click at the `datetime` **column B**, click **Format Cells...**:\n",
    "        ![format_column.jpg](./images/format_column.jpg \"format_column.jpg\")\n",
    "        <p>&nbsp;</p>\n",
    "    \n",
    "    2. Click **Custom**, and paste `YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss` in **Type:**. Then **OK**.\n",
    "        ![format_cells.jpg](./images/format_cells.jpg)\n",
    "        <p>&nbsp;</p>\n",
    "    \n",
    "    3. Now the datetime is correct, and the `LED_schedule .csv` is ready for saving\n",
    "        ![fixed_time.jpg](./images/fixed_time.jpg \"fixed_time.jpg\")\n",
    "        <p>&nbsp;</p>\n",
