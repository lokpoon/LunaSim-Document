    "# 4. Edit LED schedule .csv\n",
    "\n",
    "- One of the most powerful feature of _<span style=\"font-variant:small-caps;\">MoonShine</span>_ is that the user can create any light scenario by editing the `LED_schedule_moon.csv` or `LED_schedule_sun.csv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- While _<span style=\"font-variant:small-caps;\">MoonSim</span>_ is optimized for recreating realistic illuminance (by running the `LED_schedule_moon.csv` or `LED_schedule_sun.csv` directly from _<span style=\"font-variant:small-caps;\">MoonSim</span>: Schedulers_), we expect many experiments to require a manipulated light regime (e.g., remove a full moon night from the lunar cycle) or a purposefully standardized regime (e.g. same sunrise/set times everyday).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```{note}\n",
    "    _<span style=\"font-variant:small-caps;\">MoonShine</span>_ works by finding a matching datetime in the schedule `.csv` to the current Raspberry Pi system time. This makes re-creating the moonlight schedule at the current moment straightforward, the user would simply put in the current time in _<span style=\"font-variant:small-caps;\">MoonSim</span>: Schedulers_ to generate such a schedule `.csv`. However, this means that if the user wish to re-create a moonlight cycle in the past or future, the schedule `.csv` is required to have LED intensity values from a different time, but a datetime that matches the system current time. Instructions for doing so is detailed later.\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating customized schedules\n",
    "\n",
    "- To create a customized schedule `.csv`, the user can either modify an existing _<span style=\"font-variant:small-caps;\">MoonSim</span>_ generated schedule `.csv` using Excel. Alternatively, the user can create the customized schedule manually, using the provided `manual_scheduler.xlsx` Excel spreadsheet template (download here). The user can also combine both approaches to a create a customized `LED_schedule .csv`, because the methods are better suited for different scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "- MoonShine can run any schedule `.csv` when the following conditions are met:\n",
    "    - The .csv file contains the nine required columns (extra columns with other headers can be present, but will be ignored):\n",
    "        - datetime in is YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss format (and the user must also make sure that the schedule starts before the intended launch time, see {ref}`content:launch`).\n",
    "        - For the eight RGBW LED values (crudewhite, wfine, crudered, rfine, crudegreen, gfine, crudeblue, bfine), the user must ensure that:\n",
    "            - Crude intensity ranges from 0-255 (LED intensity level).\n",
    "            - Fine intensity ranges from 0 to the total number of LEDs in the array.\n",
    "        - The schedule `.csv` is named either `LED_schedule_moon.csv` or `LED_schedule_sun.csv`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 1: Modify an existing `LED_schedule .csv`\n",
    "- This method is suited for simple modifications such as setting a period of darkness, or repeating certain part of the existing schedule.\n",
    "- To create a novel light regime, see Option 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps\n",
    "1. First, generate a “blueprint” schedule `.csv` for a chosen location and time period, with 1 minute intervals.\n",
    "2. Then use Excel to edit the LED values (crude and fine) in the schedule `.csv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some examples of how the schedule `.csv` can be edited:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Turning off light for certain period\n",
    "    ```{figure} /images/zero.png\n",
    "    :name: zero\n",
    "\n",
    "    A dark period can be inserted simply by replacing the LED values with zero.\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Copy and pasting the LED intensity\n",
    "    ```{figure} /images/copy.jpg\n",
    "    :name: copy\n",
    "\n",
    "    Copy and pasting the LED intensity from one row to other rows at differnt times. For example, the user can copy an entire night of LED intensity progression during a full moon and paste it into another night.\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    \n",
    "- To re-create a moonlight cycle in the past or future:\n",
    "    1. Generate a schedule `.csv` in _<span style=\"font-variant:small-caps;\">MoonSim</span>: Schedulers_ with the desired settings with a start time in the past or future.\n",
    "    2. The generated schedule `.csv` will have the correct LED intensity values but a datetime that can not be launched.\n",
    "    3. Therefore, modify the datetime column in Excel so that it starts at the time the user would be launching _<span style=\"font-variant:small-caps;\">MoonShine</span>_.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(content:datetime)=\n",
    "#### Problem with Excel datetime\n",
    "- When opening a newly created schedule `.csv` in R, or with a text editor (e.g. Microsoft Notepad/Notepad++ in Microsoft Windows or TextEdit in Mac), the datetime column is presented in the following correct format: \n",
    "    - YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss\n",
    "\n",
    "```{figure} /images/original_datetime.png\n",
    ":name: original_datetime\n",
    "\n",
    "The correct datetime format when opened with a text editor.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- However, when the same schedule `.csv` is opened in Excel, the datetime will automatically reformat to the Excel's default format (this default format may depends on the user's computer's country setting). If the user then saves the schedule `.csv`  in Excel, the datetime will be saved in an erroneous format that _<span style=\"font-variant:small-caps;\">MoonShine</span>_ will not recognize.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{figure} /images/excel_datetime.png\n",
    ":name: excel_datetime\n",
    "\n",
    "The wrong datetime format is displayed when schedule `.csv` is opened in Excel. The order of year, month, and day is incorrect, the number of digits is incorrect, and the seconds are missing.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- To remedy this problem, the datetime format needs to be specified every time the user opens and then saves schedule `.csv` in Excel. To do so, the user must follow the following steps.\n",
    "    1. Right click at the datetime column header, and click **Format Cells...**:\n",
    "        ![format_column.jpg](./images/format_column.jpg \"format_column.jpg\")\n",
    "        <p>&nbsp;</p>\n",
    "    \n",
    "    2. Click **Custom**, and paste YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss in **Type:**. Then click **OK**.\n",
    "        ![format_cells.jpg](./images/format_cells.jpg \"format_cells.jpg\")\n",
    "        <p>&nbsp;</p>\n",
    "    \n",
    "    3. Now the datetime is correct, and the schedule `.csv` is ready for saving\n",
    "        ![fixed_time.jpg](./images/fixed_time.jpg \"fixed_time.jpg\")\n",
    "        <p>&nbsp;</p>\n",
    "    \n",
    "    4. This problem will reappear if the corrected schedule `.csv` file is then reopened in Excel. If the intention is to edit and re-save the LED_schedule.csv file in Excel, this datetime correction procedure must be repeated every time it is opened in Excel.\n",

    "### Option 2: Create LED schedule manually using `manual_scheduler.xlsx` \n",
    "\n",
    "- This method allows the assembly of a fully customized LED schedule. The `manual_scheduler.xlsx` file (download here) functions as a template to convert a list of desired illuminance into LED intensity values. Using this template, the user can re-create any novel illuminance schedule as desired.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps\n",
    "```{figure} /images/manualexcel.jpg\n",
    ":name: manualexcel\n",
    "\n",
    "The layout of `manual_scheduler.xlsx`. Datetime (red box), desired illuminance (orange box), RGBW LED intensity values (green), LED settings (blue), and preview plot (purple). In this example, the desired illuminance list is a linear function, increasing 0.5 lx every minute until it reaches 200 lx in 6 hours and 40 minutes.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Set the LED settings in the upper panel. The theoretical_max is the calibration illuminance, see {ref}`content:lightbox:calibration`. This value depends on whether the user is re-creating moonlight or sunlight/twilight.\n",
    "2. Create a list of datetime. This must be at 1 minute intervals.\n",
    "3. Create the list of desired illuminances in lux.\n",
    "4. The LED intensity values (crude and fine) will be updated automatically.\n",
    "5. Save this `.xlsx` file first. Since this will preserve the formatting (graph and equations).\n",
    "6. Then save this file as a `.csv`\n",
    "7. Rename this `.csv` file to `LED_schedule_moon.csv` or `LED_schedule_sun.csv` depending on what the user is re-creating in _<span style=\"font-variant:small-caps;\">MoonShine</span>_.\n",
    "8. Open the `.csv` file in Excel and correct the datetime into the correct format for _<span style=\"font-variant:small-caps;\">MoonShine</span>_, as described above.\n",
    "9. Remove the  unnecessary columns (i.e., column L and beyond).\n",
    "10. Save the file as a `.csv` file.\n",
    "11. The user can run this .csv with _<span style=\"font-variant:small-caps;\">MoonShine</span>_, or append it to an existing schedule `.csv` by matching the corresponding columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{figure} /images/manualexp.jpg\n",
    ":name: manualexp\n",
    "\n",
    "A second example of a manual schedule. The desired illuminance list consists of a natural exponent function at the start and end of the sequence, and a plateau of illuminance in the center. The LED intensity values are calculated automatically based on the desired illuminance list. _<span style=\"font-variant:small-caps;\">MoonShine</span>_ will convert these values into accurate illumination in the room.\n",
