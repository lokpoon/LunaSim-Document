    "# 4. Edit LED schedule `.csv`\n",
    "\n",
    "- One of the most powerful features of _<span style=\"font-variant:small-caps;\">MoonShineP</span>_ is that the user can create any light scenario by editing the `LED_schedule_moon.csv` or `LED_schedule_sun.csv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- While _<span style=\"font-variant:small-caps;\">MoonShineR</span>_ is optimized for recreating realistic illuminance (by running the `LED_schedule_moon.csv` or `LED_schedule_sun.csv` directly from _<span style=\"font-variant:small-caps;\">MoonShineR</span>: Schedulers_), we expect that many experiments utilizing _<span style=\"font-variant:small-caps;\">MoonShineP</span>_ will require a manipulated light regime (e.g., remove a full moon night from the lunar cycle) or a purposefully standardized regime (e.g., same sunrise/set times every day).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```{note}\n",
    "    _<span style=\"font-variant:small-caps;\">MoonShineP</span>_ works by finding a matching date/time in the schedule `.csv` to the current Raspberry Pi system time. This makes re-creating the moonlight schedule at the current moment straightforward; the user simply needs to enter the current time in _<span style=\"font-variant:small-caps;\">MoonShineR</span>: Schedulers_ to generate such a schedule `.csv`. However, this means that if the user wishes to re-create a moonlight cycle in the past or future, the schedule `.csv` is required to have LED intensity values predicted for the desired time in the past of future, but a datetime that matches the current system time. Instructions for doing so are probided below, in creating a simulation for a past or future date.\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating customized schedules\n",
    "\n",
    "- To create a customized schedule `.csv`, the user can either modify an existing _<span style=\"font-variant:small-caps;\">MoonShineR</span>_ generated schedule `.csv` using Excel. Alternatively, the user can create the customized schedule manually, using the provided Excel spreadsheet template (`manual_scheduler.xlsx`). The user can also combine both approaches to a create a customized `LED_schedule .csv`, because the methods are better suited for different scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "- _<span style=\"font-variant:small-caps;\">MoonShineP</span>_ can run any schedule `.csv` when the following conditions are met:\n",
    "    - The .csv file contains the nine required columns, as described below (extra columns with other headers can be present, but will be ignored):\n",
    "        - The first column is '_datetime_' in YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss format (see {numref}`original_datetime`)(and the user must also make sure that the schedule starts before the intended launch time, see {ref}`content:launch`).\n",
    "        - The next eight columns are the For the eight RGBW LED values, i.e., 'crude' and 'fine' settings for each of white, read green, and blue. These are labeled '_crudewhite_', '_wfine_', '_crudered_', '_rfine_', '_crudegreen_', '_gfine_', '_crudeblue_', '_bfine_' (see {numref}`moon_table`). The user must ensure that:\n",
    "            - Crude intensity values ranges from 0-255 (LED intensity level).\n",
    "            - Fine intensity values ranges from 0 to the total number of LEDs in the array.\n",
    "        - The schedule `.csv` is named either `LED_schedule_moon.csv` or `LED_schedule_sun.csv`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 1: Modify an existing `LED_schedule .csv`\n",
    "- This method is suited for simple modifications such as setting a period of darkness,repeating certain part of the existing schedule, or re-creating a moonlight cycle in the past or future.\n",
    "- To create a novel light regime, see Option 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps\n",
    "1. First, generate a “blueprint” schedule `.csv` for a chosen location and time period, with 1 minute intervals.\n",
    "2. Then use Excel to edit the '_datetime_' and/or the LED intensity values (crude and fine) in the schedule `.csv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are examples of how the schedule `.csv` can be edited:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Turning off light for certain period:\n",
    "```{figure} /images/zero.png\n",
    ":name: zero\n",
    "\n",
    "A dark period can be simply inserted simply by replacing the LED values with zero.\n",
    "```\n",
    "    \n",
    "##### Copy and paste the LED intensity:\n",
    "```{figure} /images/copy.jpg\n",
    ":name: copy\n",
    "\n",
    "Copy and paste the LED intensity from one row to other rows at different times. For example, the user can copy an entire night of LED intensity progression during a full moon and paste it into another night.\n",
    "```\n",
    "    \n",
    "##### To re-create a moonlight cycle in the past or future:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Generate a schedule `.csv` in _<span style=\"font-variant:small-caps;\">MoonShineR</span>: Schedulers_ with the desired settings and with a start time in the past or future.\n",
    "2. The generated schedule `.csv` will have the correct LED intensity values but a date/time that can not be launched immediately as the date is not current.\n",
    "3. Therefore, the user would replace the starting date/time of the re-created illumination schedule (from a past or future date) with the current date/time for the moonlight re-creation. To do so:\n",
    "    - Delete all the original entries in the '_datetime_' column except for the first two rows.\n",
    "    - Edit the entries in the first two rows with the new date/time, so that the first row is the desired start time and the second row is the first row's time + 1 minute.\n",
    "    - Select the first two date/time, and use the Excel ‘fill handle’ to copy a new sequence of date/time values, at 1 min intervals, through until the last row of the simulation.\n",
    "    - Make sure DST is not applied to any date-time values in the edited column.\n",
    "    - See the next section to save the date/time in the correct format.\n",
    "\n",
    "(content:datetime)=\n",
    "#### Problem with Excel datetime\n",
    "- When opening a newly created schedule `.csv` in R, or with a text editor (e.g. Microsoft Notepad/Notepad++ in Microsoft Windows or TextEdit in Mac), the '_datetime_' column is presented in the following correct format: \n",
    "    - YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss\n",
    "\n",
    "```{figure} /images/original_datetime.png\n",
    ":name: original_datetime\n",
    "\n",
    "The correct date/time format when opened with a text editor.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- However, when the same schedule `.csv` is opened in Excel, the date/time will automatically reformat to the Excel's default format (this default format may depends on the user's computer's country setting). If the user then saves the schedule `.csv`  in Excel, the date/time will be saved in an erroneous format that _<span style=\"font-variant:small-caps;\">MoonShineP</span>_ will not recognize.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{figure} /images/excel_datetime.png\n",
    ":name: excel_datetime\n",
    "\n",
    "The wrong date/time format is displayed when schedule `.csv` is opened in Excel. The order of year, month, and day is incorrect, the number of digits is incorrect, and the seconds are missing.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- To remedy this problem, the date/time format needs to be specified every time the user opens and then saves schedule `.csv` in Excel. To do so, the user must follow the following steps.\n",
    "    1. Right click at the '_datetime_' column header, and click **Format Cells...**:\n",
    "        ![format_column.jpg](./images/format_column.jpg \"format_column.jpg\")\n",
    "        <p>&nbsp;</p>\n",
    "    \n",
    "    2. Click **Custom**, and paste YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss in **Type:**. Then click **OK**.\n",
    "        ![format_cells.jpg](./images/format_cells.jpg \"format_cells.jpg\")\n",
    "        <p>&nbsp;</p>\n",
    "    \n",
    "    3. Now the date/time is correct, and the schedule `.csv` is ready for saving.\n",
    "        ![fixed_time.jpg](./images/fixed_time.jpg \"fixed_time.jpg\")\n",
    "        <p>&nbsp;</p>\n",
    "    \n",
    "    4. This problem will reappear if the corrected schedule `.csv` file is then reopened in Excel. If the intention is to edit and re-save the `LED_schedule.csv` file in Excel, this date/time correction procedure must be repeated every time it is opened in Excel.\n",

    "### Option 2: Create LED schedule manually using `manual_scheduler.xlsx` \n",
    "\n",
    "- This method allows the assembly of a fully customized LED schedule. The `manual_scheduler.xlsx` file (download in {ref}`content:lightbox:download`) functions as a template to convert a list of desired illuminances into LED intensity values. Using this template, the user can re-create any novel illuminance schedule as desired.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps\n",
    "```{figure} /images/manualexcel.jpg\n",
    ":name: manualexcel\n",
    "\n",
    "The layout of `manual_scheduler.xlsx`. '_datetime_' (red box), '_desired illuminance_' (orange box), RGBW LED intensity values (green), LED settings (blue), and preview plot (purple). In this example, the desired illuminance list is a linear function, increasing 0.5 lx every minute until it reaches 200 lx in 6 hours and 40 minutes.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{figure} /images/manualexp.jpg\n",
    ":name: manualexp\n",
    "\n",
    "A second example of a manual schedule showing only the preview plot. The desired illuminance list consists of a natural exponent function at the start and end of the sequence, and a plateau of illuminance in the center. The LED intensity values are calculated automatically based on the desired illuminance list. _<span style=\"font-variant:small-caps;\">MoonShineP</span>_ will convert these values into accurate illumination in the room.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Set the LED settings in the upper right panel ({numref}`manualexcel`). The theoretical_max is the calibration illuminance, see {ref}`content:lightbox:calibration`.\n",
    "2. Fill in the '_datetime_' column. This must be at 1 minute intervals.\n",
    "3. Create the list of desired illuminances in lux. See ({numref}`manualexcel`) for an example.\n",
    "4. The LED intensity values (crude and fine) will be updated automatically.\n",
    "5. Save this `.xlsx` file first because this will preserve the formatting (graph and equations).\n",
    "6. Then save this file as a separate `.csv` file, using \"save as\".\n",
    "7. Rename this newly created `.csv` file to `LED_schedule_moon.csv` or `LED_schedule_sun.csv` depending on what the user is re-creating in _<span style=\"font-variant:small-caps;\">MoonShineP</span>_.\n",
    "8. Open this `.csv` file in Excel to correct the '_datetime_' into the correct format for _<span style=\"font-variant:small-caps;\">MoonShineP</span>_, as described above.\n",
    "9. Remove the unnecessary columns (i.e., column L and beyond).\n",
    "10. Save changes.\n",
    "11. The user can run this finalized `.csv` with _<span style=\"font-variant:small-caps;\">MoonShineP</span>_, or append it to an existing schedule `.csv` by matching the corresponding columns."
