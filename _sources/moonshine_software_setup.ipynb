    "\n",
    "A real time clock module is optional but recommended. We recommend that the user runs the Pi offline, and instead uses the RTC to keep time. This is because when the Pi is online it will automatically update to the local time. This may use daylight saving time, DST, which can be troublesome. The RTC is also essential if the Pi is used in a location with no internet connection.\n",
