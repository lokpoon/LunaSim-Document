    "*[1] Equivalent kit of the Raspberry Pi 4 model B from any company would work. Beside the Pi itself, the kit should include all the accessories such as cable, power supply, case, SD card, etc. You only need the 2GB RAM option, but you can opt for more RAM (4GB or 8GB) if budget allows.\n",

    "You only need one Pi for moonlight recreation or sunlight and twilight recreation. You can use two Pi in conjunction to recreate both.\n",

    "*[2] We recommend the following options: 1m, 144 LED, Warm White. There is also the option of IP65 water resistant and IP30 normal version, choose the one more suitable for your application. Choose warm white because we do not want the big blue spike in the white channel spectrum. You can pick a different length and LED number as needed, but we believe 1m 144 LED is the best suited for most situations.\n",

    "*[6] Lux meter is just a commercial term for radiometer, both measure illuminance in lx. We need to measure the illuminance of the LED for calibrating it. Spectrometer is like an upgraded radiometer. It measures spectral irradiance, giving you spectral information about the light. And spectral irradiance measurements can be easily converted into illuminance. Spectrometer is generally high cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "An accurate illuminance measuring device is critical for calibrating LS-lightbox, but a good one designed for low light is expensive. We do not want the cost of a good radiometer to discourage the use of LS-lightbox for moonlight experiments. Still, you should certainly get a meter that has NIST-Traceable calibration, like this [ILT10C](https://www.intl-lighttech.com/products/ilt10c-luxlight-meter-nist-traceable-calibration?gclid=Cj0KCQiAw8OeBhCeARIsAGxWtUzB0YaQDpYF5fXMYee-U9zSQgnbmph4LrlmD0inkbSdw4FtaJ-AjjsaApwYEALw_wcB). Lower cost meters can not measure at moonlight illuminance level (i.e., >0.3lux), still we can calibrate the LS-lightbox. Please see further explanations and solutions in the \"LS-lightbox calibration\" section.\n",
