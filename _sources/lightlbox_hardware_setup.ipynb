    "[^1]: Equivalent kit of the Raspberry Pi 4 model B from any company would work. Beside the Pi itself, the kit should include all the accessories such as cable, power supply, case, SD card, etc. You only need the 2GB RAM option, but you can opt for more RAM (4GB or 8GB) if budget allows.\n",

Choose warm white because we do not want the big blue spike in the white channel spectrum. You can pick a different length and LED number as needed, but we believe 1m 144 LED is the best suited for most situations.\n",

    "[^6]: \"Lux meter\" is just a commercial term for radiometer, both measure illuminance in lx. We need to measure the illuminance of the LED for calibrating it. Spectrometer is like an upgraded radiometer. It measures spectral irradiance, giving you spectral information about the light. And spectral irradiance measurements can be easily converted into illuminance. Spectrometer is generally high cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "An accurate illuminance measuring device is critical for calibrating LS-lightbox, but a good one designed for low light is expensive. We do not want the cost of a good radiometer to discourage the use of LS-lightbox for moonlight experiments. Still, you should certainly get a meter that has NIST-Traceable calibration, like this [ILT10C](https://www.intl-lighttech.com/products/ilt10c-luxlight-meter-nist-traceable-calibration?gclid=Cj0KCQiAw8OeBhCeARIsAGxWtUzB0YaQDpYF5fXMYee-U9zSQgnbmph4LrlmD0inkbSdw4FtaJ-AjjsaApwYEALw_wcB). Lower cost meters can not measure at moonlight illuminance level (i.e., >0.3lux), still we can calibrate the LS-lightbox. Please see further explanations and solutions in the \"LS-lightbox calibration\" section.\n",

    "        - Red wire goes into the 5V PIN.\n",
    "        - White wire goes into the ground PIN.\n",
    "        - Green wire goes into the GPIO 18 data PIN.\n",
    "5. On the other end of the 3 conductor wire, solder on and heat shrink the 3-pin cable female connector (comes with the LED strip).\n",
    "6. Connect the female connector to the LED strip male connector.\n",
    "7. Install the power female connector (comes with the DC power supply) to the voltage-adding wires (loose red and white).\n",
    "8. Plug in DC power supply.\n",
    "9. Connector to additional LED strips by daisy chaining from the other end of the first LED strip. Add additional DC power supply on subsequent LED strips.\n",
    "10. Install the RTC module as shown in {numref}`schematic` & {numref}`cable`, so that it is on the same end of the crimp connector and next to it. \n",

    "4. Drill a small hole on each end of the box for the cables. Plug it with small pieces of foam to prevent light leak.\n",
    "5. Cut ND filter sheets into the correct size, and secure them on the top opening with masking tape. Ensure no light leak. See {ref}`content:lightbox:calibration` regarding how many ND filter sheets to use."
