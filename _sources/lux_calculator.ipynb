    "## Key features\n",
    "\n",
    "- Provides an accurate prediction of moonlight illuminance at any geographic location and over any time period, at user-defined intervals.\n",
    "- Provides a prediction of twilight and sunlight illuminance as well.\n",
    "- Generates a `.csv` table of predicted illuminance over time.\n",
    "- Provides a high-resolution plot of illuminance over time with simple customization.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```{note}\n",
    "    The sunlight and twilight illuminance are predicted by the sun's altitude only, and are not intended to be highly accurate predictions of the absolute illuminance.\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    ```{tip}\n",
    "    This website [R Coder](https://r-coder.com/r-tutorials/r-basics/) is a good resource for learning basic R functions. Start here if you are completely new to R and need instructions on how to load R, set the working directory, install packages and run code.\n",
