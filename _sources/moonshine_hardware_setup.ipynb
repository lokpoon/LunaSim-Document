Beside the Raspberry Pi itself, the kit should include all the accessories such as HDMI cable, power supply, case, SD card, etc. _<span style=\"font-variant:small-caps;\">MoonShineP</span>_ only requires the 2GB RAM option, but there are options for more RAM (4GB or 8GB).\n",

    "[^2]: We strongly recommend the following options: 1m, 144 LED, Warm White. There are IP65 water resistant and IP30 normal versions available for this model. The user can choose one suitable for the required application. We picked warm white to avoid a substantial blue spike in the white channel spectrum. A different strip length and LED number can be selected, but the 1m 144 LED is the best suited for most situations, and the default options in the _<span style=\"font-variant:small-caps;\">MoonShineR</span>_ suite will work for this model.\n",

    "[^7]: “Lux meter” is a commercial term for a radiometer; these devices measure illuminance in lux. A measure of illuminance is essential to calibrate <span style=\"font-variant:small-caps;\">MoonShineP</span>. A spectrometer is a radiometer that measures spectral irradiance – measures of light intensity values across (and just outside) the visible light spectrum. Spectral irradiance measurements can easily be converted into illuminance. Spectrometers are generally more expensive than radiometers, although precision low-light sensitive radiometers suitable for quantifying moonlight levels are also expensive.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    An accurate illuminance measuring device is critical for calibrating MoonShineP, but ones that measures at low light are very expensive. We do not want the cost of the radiometer to discourage the use of <span style=\"font-variant:small-caps;\">MoonShineP</span> for moonlight related experiments. Still, it is critical to obtain a meter that has NIST-Traceable calibration, like the International Light Technology [ILT10C](https://www.intl-lighttech.com/products/ilt10c-luxlight-meter-nist-traceable-calibration?gclid=Cj0KCQiAw8OeBhCeARIsAGxWtUzB0YaQDpYF5fXMYee-U9zSQgnbmph4LrlmD0inkbSdw4FtaJ-AjjsaApwYEALw_wcB) (lower limit of 10 lx, cost ~$350). Lower cost meters do not perform accurately at moonlight level illuminance (i.e., <0.3 lx). Where only a non low-light sensitive radiometer is available (able to read below 1E-2 lx with a resolution +/- 1E-2 lx or better), like the ILT10C,  <span style=\"font-variant:small-caps;\">MoonShineP</span> can be calibrated using a comparative method. See further explanations and solutions in {ref}`content:lightbox:radiometer`.\n",
