    "[^6]: \"Lux meter\" is just a commercial term for radiometer, both measure illuminance in lx. We need to measure the illuminance to calibrate Moonshine. Spectrometer is like an upgraded radiometer. It measures spectral irradiance, which provides spectral information about the light. Meanwhile, spectral irradiance measurements can easily be converted into illuminance. However, spectrometers generally carries high cost.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    An accurate illuminance measuring device is critical for calibrating Moonshine, but ones that measures at low light are very expensive. We do not want the cost of the radiometer to discourage the use of Moonshine for moonlight related experiments. Still, it is critical to obtain a meter that has NIST-Traceable calibration, like this [ILT10C](https://www.intl-lighttech.com/products/ilt10c-luxlight-meter-nist-traceable-calibration?gclid=Cj0KCQiAw8OeBhCeARIsAGxWtUzB0YaQDpYF5fXMYee-U9zSQgnbmph4LrlmD0inkbSdw4FtaJ-AjjsaApwYEALw_wcB). Lower cost meters can not measure at moonlight level illuminance (i.e., >0.3lux), still we can calibrate Moonshine through a comparative method.
