    "# 8. <span style=\"font-variant:small-caps;\">MoonShine</span>: Launch procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter goes over how to launch _<span style=\"font-variant:small-caps;\">MoonShine</span>_, using the example of re-creating moonlight only (i.e., using the moon version of the files, the filenames ending with \"moon\"). The moon version files include: `moonshine_moon.py` and `LED_schedule_moon.csv` located within *Desktop/control_moon* (on the Raspberry Pi Linux Desktop). And the systemd service `moonshine_moon.service`. The user should apply the same procedures for launching the sunlight/twilight system, using the sun version of the files, namely `moonshine_sun.py` and `LED_schedule_sun.csv` located within *Desktop/control_sun*. And the systemd service `moonshine_sun.service`.\n",
    "  \n",
    "The user should follow all other chapters before performing a launch, and ensure that calibration has been performed. Here we continue from the software setup section {ref}`content:systemd`, in which a `moonshine_moon.service` that link to the `moonshine_moon.py` located in *Desktop/control_moon* was created.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "Things to check before the launch:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Generate a working `LED_schedule_moon.csv`\n",
    "\n",
    "- On a computer, generate an `LED_schedule_moon.csv` using the <span style=\"font-variant:small-caps;\">MoonSim</span> scheduler, with the  desired parameters. Make sure that the time zone was set correctly, and is a time zone without without daylight saving time (DST). Move the `LED_schedule_moon.csv` into the Raspberry Pi's *Desktop/control_moon*\n",
    "\n",
    "- For the `moonshine_moon.py` to run, the `LED_schedule_moon.csv` must contain a row matching the time at launch. In other words, there cannot be a `LED_schedule.csv` where the first row is a time in the future. So, when creating the `LED_schedule.csv`, _do not_ set the beginning date time ahead of launching _<span style=\"font-variant:small-caps;\">MoonShine</span>_.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For example, lets say that the user is launching <span style=\"font-variant:small-caps;\">MoonShine</span> at noon but does not want the LED arrays to start a light re-creation until midnight. In this case, the user should generate a `LED_schedule_moon.csv` by specifying noon as the start time in <span style=\"font-variant:small-caps;\">MoonSim: Moonlight led scheduler</span>. Then open the `LED_schedule_moon.csv` in Excel and edit the rows of LED crude and fine value before midnight to zero. Having launched this edited `LED_schedule_moon.csv` at noon, the user can expect it to light up starting at midnight. Between noon (the launch time), the launch time, and midnight, the simulation will run, but because the LEDs rows have been edited to zero, there will be no illumination.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For the same reason, the user should never delete entire rows with excel in the middle of the `LED_schedule_moon.csv`. This will cause errors. If dark periods are required, the user must instead replace the LED illumination value with zeros.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Check that datetime is in the correct format. See {ref}`content:datetime`\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Check the location of files\n",
    "\n",
    "- Within *Desktop/control_moon*, check that the following files are present (if not add them)\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - `moonshine_moon.py`\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - `LED_schedule_moon.csv`\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Make sure that the LED strips are not frozen\n",
    "\n",
    "- The LED strips should never freeze during operation. However, they may become unresponsive after the `moonshine_moon.service` is stopped, or due to other accidents such as a loose connection in the GPIO cable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To reset the LED array, unplug both the power and the GPIO cable, and reconnect them. It is advisable to turn off the Raspberry Pi before disconnecting the power and GPIO connections. \n",
    "\n",
    "## To run `moonshine_moon.service`\n",
    "\n",
    "In the terminal,\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Enable the service file:\n",
    "   \n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    sudo systemctl enable moonshine_moon.service\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - _<span style=\"font-variant:small-caps;\">MoonShine</span>_ should be up and running once the system clock hits 00 second.\n",
    "   \n",
    "      ```{note}\n",
    "      The Raspberry Pi does not have a sleep mode or other energy saving modes, so there is no need to worry about these settings.\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "2. To see if the service is active, enter:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    systemctl list-units --type=service --state=active\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ```{figure} /images/active_service.png\n",
    "    :name: active_service\n",
    "\n",
    "    A list of active systemd service.\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Check CPU usage, by entering:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   htop\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   \n",
    "    ```{note}\n",
    "       Starting 8 sec before the start of every minute, one (two if running two service, both moon and sunlight recreation) of the CPU cores will increase usage to 100%. Moonshine_moon.service will be listed as the top task in the list. This is normal.The LED will be be updated at the start of the minute, and CPU usage will return to normal.\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    ```{figure} /images/htop.png\n",
    "    :name: htop\n",
    "\n",
    "    Two CPUs at 100% usage just before the start of every minute, as the `moonshine_moon.py` and `moonshine_sun.py` are searching for a matching datetime to the current time. \n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. A `log.txt` file will be created in *Desktop/control_moon*. This logs allows the user to check the LED intensity values of the first 3 LEDs in the array. This file be erased upon restarting `moonshine_moon.service`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Stopping the service file will stop Moonshineâ€™s Python code from continuing to refresh the LEDs (the LEDs will remain at the last intensity). This is the only way to stop _<span style=\"font-variant:small-caps;\">MoonShine</span>_.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - To stop the service file enter the following into the terminal:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   sudo systemctl stop moonshine_moon.service\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   \n",
    "5. To completely turn off the LED strips (which remain at their last intensity after Step 4 is completed), the user should run the following two Python scripts, `clear_moon.py` (download here) and `clear_sun.py` (download here).\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Place both these files on the Raspberry Pi desktop.\n",
    "    - Then, to turn off the LEDS in a moonlight simulation, in terminal enter:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    sudo python3 Desktop/clear_moon.py\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    - To turn off the LEDS in a sunlight simulation, enter.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    sudo python3 Desktop/clear_sun.py\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```{attention}\n",
    "    Whenever the Raspberry Pi is rebooted, `moonshine_moon.service` and `moonshine_sun.service` launchs automatically. Even when the user stops the systemd service, it will start itself upon a reboot.\n",
    "    ```"
